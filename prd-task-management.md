# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Task Management

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered task management feature. 

The primary goal is to reduce manual task creation overhead and improve task prioritization through AI assistance, while maintaining human control over all actions. This feature will help CSMs stay organized and ensure important customer-related tasks are not overlooked.

## Goals

1. **Streamline Task Management**: Provide a centralized system for CSMs to manage customer-related tasks
2. **AI-Assisted Task Creation**: Mock AI task generation to demonstrate future capabilities while providing manual task creation
3. **Intelligent Prioritization**: Enable AI-driven task reprioritization based on multiple customer and business factors
4. **Contextual Task Actions**: Provide relevant AI-suggested actions based on task type and content
5. **Customer Association**: Seamlessly link tasks to customer accounts for better context
6. **Team Collaboration**: Support multi-assignee tasks with flexible completion models

## User Stories

**As a CSM, I want to:**
- Manually create tasks for customer accounts so that I can track important follow-ups
- See AI-created tasks (mocked) so that I understand how the system will work in the future
- View AI-suggested actions for each task so that I can efficiently complete customer-related work
- Associate tasks with specific customer companies so that I can maintain context
- Assign tasks to team members using @mentions so that work can be distributed
- Decline AI-generated tasks so that irrelevant tasks don't clutter my workflow
- View a prioritized list of tasks so that I can focus on the most important work first
- Mark tasks as complete so that I can track progress
- See an activity log for each task so that I can understand what has happened

**As an Account Manager, I want to:**
- Receive task assignments via @mentions so that I know when I have new work
- Complete multi-assignee tasks independently so that work isn't blocked by others
- Categorize tasks with tags so that I can organize different types of work

## Functional Requirements

### Task Creation
1. The system must allow users to manually create tasks with title, description, due date, priority, and company association
2. The system must display mocked AI-generated tasks to demonstrate future functionality
3. The system must allow users to decline AI-generated tasks, which will delete the task
4. The system must support @mentions in task content to assign tasks to other users
5. The system must support @mentions in task content to associate tasks with companies

### Task Management
6. The system must categorize tasks using predefined tags
7. The system must allow tasks to have multiple assignees
8. The system must allow any assignee to mark a multi-assignee task as complete
9. The system must allow AI to mark tasks as complete (future capability)
10. The system must allow users to delete tasks manually
11. The system must support three priority levels: High, Medium, Low
12. The system must support due dates (date only, not time)

### Task Display and Organization
13. The system must display tasks in a list view format
14. The system must sort tasks by date with most recent on top
15. The system must not provide additional filtering, sorting, or search capabilities in this version
16. The system must display task details including all necessary context based on task type

### Company Integration
17. The system must provide a dropdown with autocomplete for selecting companies
18. The system must integrate with existing company/contact data in the platform
19. The system must display a link to the customer/company in task details

### AI Features (Current Scope)
20. The system must suggest contextual actions based on task type and content
21. The system must prepare drafts for suggested actions (e.g., draft emails, meeting agendas)
22. The system must require user approval before executing any suggested actions
23. The system must support AI reprioritization of tasks (integration point for future AI agent)

### Activity and Collaboration
24. The system must maintain an activity log for each task including: creation, edits, status changes, comments, AI actions, and completion
25. The system must allow users to add comments/notes to tasks
26. The system must track when AI suggests or completes actions

### User Interface Requirements
27. The system must be implemented as a web application
28. The system must integrate seamlessly with the existing platform UI
29. The system must provide in-app notifications for task-related events
30. The system must not provide external notifications in this version

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **AI Task Creation**: Actual AI task generation from emails, meeting transcripts, or support tickets
- **AI Agent Integration**: Full AI agent implementation for automatic reprioritization
- **Autonomous AI Actions**: AI taking actions without user approval (e.g., sending emails automatically)
- **External Notifications**: Push notifications, email alerts, or SMS notifications
- **User Management**: User creation, authentication, or permission management
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search functionality, custom filters, or advanced sorting options
- **Tag Management**: Admin interface for creating/managing predefined tags
- **Mention Notifications**: Automatic notifications when users are mentioned in tasks
- **Multiple Task Views**: Board/Kanban or calendar views
- **Integration Setup**: Calendar integration or external system connections
- **Standalone App**: This is a feature within an existing platform, not a separate application

## Design Considerations

### Task Types and Actions
Different task types should have tailored content and suggested actions:
- **Email Customer**: Draft email, schedule follow-up
- **Schedule Call**: Prepare agenda, send calendar invite
- **Review Contract**: Create summary, identify key dates
- **Follow-up**: Draft message, set reminder

### User Experience
- Keep the interface simple and focused on the list view
- Ensure AI suggestions are clearly marked and require explicit user approval
- Make company association prominent and easy to use
- Design for frequent task creation and quick completion

### Customer Context
- Provide easy access to customer information from task details
- Ensure company dropdown is fast and responsive with autocomplete
- Link directly to customer profiles in the existing platform

## Technical Considerations

- **Platform**: Node.js web application
- **Integration**: Must integrate with existing company/contact data
- **Database**: Extend existing data models for tasks, activity logs, and associations
- **UI Framework**: Consistent with existing platform design system
- **Performance**: Optimize autocomplete for large customer databases
- **Future Readiness**: Design task structure to accommodate future AI integration

## Open Questions

1. **Predefined Tags**: What should the initial set of predefined tags include?
2. **AI Mock Data**: What specific examples should be used for mocked AI-generated tasks?
3. **Task Limits**: Should there be any limits on number of tasks per user or company?
4. **Data Retention**: How long should completed/deleted tasks and activity logs be retained?
5. **Permissions**: Are there any role-based restrictions on task creation, assignment, or completion?
6. **Integration Points**: What specific APIs or data models exist for companies and users in the current platform?

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of CSMs actively creating and managing tasks
- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of created tasks that are completed vs. deleted
- **AI Suggestion Acceptance**: Rate at which users accept AI-suggested actions
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on task management efficiency and AI assistance quality
